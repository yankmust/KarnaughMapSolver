# KarnaughMapSolver
The Karnaugh Map Solver project that I made for Logic Circuits Design class with Java.
You need to create a .text file that will be in the following format: 
''değişkenler: x, y, z, t
diyagram:
1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
0 0 1 0
1 0 0 0''

You can write any variable names, it will be still working. You can enter 3 or 4 variables. It's that simple.
